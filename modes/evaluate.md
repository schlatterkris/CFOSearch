# Mode: offer — Full A-F Evaluation

When the candidate pastes an offer (text or URL), ALWAYS deliver all 6 blocks:

## Step 0 — Archetype Detection

Classify the offer into one of the 6 archetypes (see `_shared.md`). If hybrid, indicate the 2 closest. This determines:
- Which proof points to prioritize in block B
- How to rewrite the summary in block E
- Which STAR stories to prepare in block F

## Block A — Role Summary

Table with:
- Detected archetype
- Domain (platform/agentic/LLMOps/ML/enterprise)
- Function (build/consult/manage/deploy)
- Seniority
- Remote (full/hybrid/onsite)
- Team size (if mentioned)
- TL;DR in 1 sentence

## Block B — CV Match

Read `cv.md`. Create table mapping each JD requirement to exact CV lines.

**Adapted to archetype:**
- If Product Operations → prioritize operational process design, cross-functional scaling metrics, data-driven decision frameworks (MTTR 75% reduction, 99.999% availability, 71% ticket reduction)
- If Technical Program Management → prioritize matrix leadership across 5 regions, 10+ functions, regulated environment delivery
- If Product Enablement/Integration → prioritize R&D-to-market bridge, API platform scaling ($1.6B), technical training programs
- If Platform/API PM → prioritize global API integration frameworks, platform scaling across regions, developer enablement
- If Fintech/Regulated Ops → prioritize Mastercard compliance/security track record, incident governance, regulated market delivery
- If Transformation → prioritize operational turnaround (Barry-Wehmiller), workflow automation, process re-engineering

**Gaps section** with mitigation strategy for each gap. For each gap:
1. Is it a hard blocker or a nice-to-have?
2. Can the candidate demonstrate adjacent experience?
3. Is there a portfolio project that covers this gap?
4. Concrete mitigation plan (cover letter phrase, quick project, etc.)

## Block C — Level and Strategy

1. **Detected level** in JD vs **natural candidate level for that archetype**
2. **"Sell senior without lying" plan**: specific phrases adapted to archetype, concrete achievements to highlight, how to position founder experience as an advantage
3. **"If they downlevel me" plan**: accept if comp is fair, negotiate review at 6 months, clear promotion criteria

## Block D — Comp and Demand

Use WebSearch for:
- Current salaries for the role (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind)
- Company's compensation reputation
- Role demand trend

Table with data and cited sources. If no data, say so instead of inventing.

## Block E — Personalization Plan

| # | Section | Current State | Proposed Change | Why |
|---|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| 1 | Summary | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Top 5 changes to CV + Top 5 changes to LinkedIn to maximize match.

## Block F — Interview Plan

6-10 STAR+R stories mapped to JD requirements (STAR + **Reflection**):

| # | JD Requirement | STAR+R Story | S | T | A | R | Reflection |
|---|----------------|--------------|---|---|---|---|------------|

The **Reflection** column captures what was learned or what would be done differently. This signals seniority — junior candidates describe what happened, senior candidates extract lessons.

**Story Bank:** If `interview-prep/story-bank.md` exists, check if any of these stories are already there. If not, append new ones. Over time this builds a reusable bank of 5-10 master stories that can be adapted to any interview question.

**Selected and framed according to archetype:**
- Product Operations → emphasize process design, operational metrics, cross-functional execution
- Technical Program Management → emphasize multi-region delivery, stakeholder alignment, deadline execution
- Product Enablement/Integration → emphasize platform launch, integration frameworks, partner delivery
- Platform/API PM → emphasize API ecosystem, developer adoption, platform scaling
- Fintech/Regulated Ops → emphasize compliance delivery, security governance, regulated market execution
- Transformation → emphasize turnaround metrics, automation adoption, organizational change

Also include:
- 1 recommended case study (which of their projects to present and how)
- Red-flag questions and how to answer them (e.g., "why did you sell your company?", "do you have a reports team?")

## Post-Evaluation

**ALWAYS** after generating blocks A-F:

### 1. Save report .md

Save complete evaluation to `reports/{###}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.

- `{###}` = next sequential number (3 digits, zero-padded)
- `{company-slug}` = company name in lowercase, no spaces (use hyphens)
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` = current date

**Report format:**

```markdown
# Evaluation: {Company} — {Role}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Archetype:** {detected}
**Score:** {X/5}
**PDF:** {path or pending}
**URL:** {original job posting URL}
